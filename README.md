# Weather app API
App started as taks by my first job interview.
After 3 years I decided to fix it and customize for me and my family.

## How it works?
All weather data fetched from external API.
I have chosen regions where my relatives lives, in this case:
- Slovakia - Bratislava, Modra, Michalovce
- Italy - Rome
- United Kingdom - Leeds
- Australia - Gold Coast

Rendered to interactive table which includes: `time zone`, `temperature`, `sky condition`, `wind speed`, `humidity`.
Also color of the table row and icons depends on `temperature`.

*Example*:

| CITY | TIME | TEMPERATURE | SKY | WIND SPEED | HUMIDITY |
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | ---------- | --------|
| Gold Coast | 29. 9. - 20:18 h | 19.98Â°C | <icon> clear sky | 4.63m/s | 84%|
